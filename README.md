## Project Description

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

Build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.
Users should be able to:

- Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid. 
- Choose a color. 
- Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

## Project Specification 

- The user can create a canvas of any (reasonable) size. 
- Entering whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, causes an empty grid to appear on the page. 
- The user can color the pixels in the grid. 
- Choosing a color from the color selector and clicking on a grid square causes that grid square (and only that square) to change color. - Event listeners are properly added to the grid squares (and not to the border or the table itself). 
- The user can reset the grid to a blank state. 
- If there are already colored squares in the grid, clicking the Submit button clears them out.
